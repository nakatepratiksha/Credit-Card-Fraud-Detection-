Context:

Credit card fraud detection involves identifying rare fraudulent transactions hidden within a huge number of legitimate transactions. In this problem, the dataset is highly imbalanced, with the vast majority of transactions being normal. This imbalance poses a significant challenge because standard classifiers tend to be biased toward the majority class, potentially missing the infrequent yet critical fraudulent transactions.

Problem Statement:

The objective is to build a model that can effectively detect fraud while minimizing false negatives (missing fraudulent transactions) and false positives (wrongly flagging genuine transactions as fraudulent). Since the data is severely imbalanced, applying conventional machine learning methods may result in a model that overlooks fraudulent cases. To counter this, techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) are used to balance the training data.

Approach:

Data Exploration:
Initially, it is observed that the dataset contains a large number of legitimate transactions compared to very few fraudulent ones.
A simple plot of the class distribution shows a stark imbalance.
Data Balancing with SMOTE:
SMOTE is applied to the training data to synthetically generate more samples of the fraudulent class.
As a result, both classes become balanced prior to training.
Model Building:
A Logistic Regression model is built using the balanced data.
The model is then evaluated on unseen test data.
Model Evaluation:
The accuracy of the model is high due to the large number of normal transactions.
However, while the model achieves high recall in detecting fraud (meaning it detects most fraudulent transactions), the precision is very low. This means that many normal transactions are also flagged as fraud, leading to a high false positive rate.

Conclusion:

High Recall vs. Low Precision:
The model is good at detecting fraud (high recall) but also incorrectly flags many legitimate transactions as fraudulent (low precision).
Need for Further Refinement:
Additional techniques such as advanced feature engineering, cost-sensitive learning, or ensemble methods could help reduce false positives while maintaining detection sensitivity.
Practical Implications:
Although the current approach improves fraud detection sensitivity, the high rate of false alarms might lead to customer inconvenience. Therefore, further improvements are necessary before practical deployment.
